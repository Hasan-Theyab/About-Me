        - It went very good except some little things.
          
          I have an observation about eslint for js file, my code didn't match completly with eslint.
          
          It took me 4 hours to complete this assignment,before I startedthis assignment I thought it would take me 1-2 hours to complete this assignment

          I see myself deeply involved in planning and evaluating my learning

          I will record and/or measure the knowledge that I want to acquire

          I will evaluate what I want to learn continuously
